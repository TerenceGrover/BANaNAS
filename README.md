# üçå BANaNAS - The Data Correlation App üçå
Welcome to BANaNAS, a web app developed by a team of four software engineering students with a passion for data analysis and a curious streak. The idea behind BANaNAS is to take two random pieces of data from around the web and see if they're related in any way. It's like a game of "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" but with data, and you never know what kind of interesting pattern you might uncover.

## Concept
We believe that data analysis should be accessible to everyone, not just experts in the field. That's why we've created BANaNAS, a tool that allows users to explore data in a fun and interactive way. With BANaNAS, you never know what kind of connection you might make. It all started with a spark of inspiration and a lot of hard work, and we're excited to share BANaNAS with the world. So go ahead, give it a try and see what kind of interesting connections you can make.

## How it works
BANaNAS uses top-secret algorithms to aggregate data and find correlations, but please keep in mind that the correlations found by BANaNAS should be taken with a grain of salt and a dash of humor. We encourage users to check out the sources and do their own analysis, as correlation does not equal causation.

## Creators
BANaNAS was created by:

[Alex] (https://github.com/alexryanjones) : A design magician with a focus on frontend. His organization and forward thinking made it all come together as smooth as a good slice of Banana Bread.

[Alessio] (https://github.com/Al366io) : A backend genius that can give endpoints faster than you can ask for them.

[Seth] (https://github.com/sethjplatt) : Organized and efficient, he's the glue that holds the team together. With him working on the backend, you know the app is in good hands.

[Terence] (https://github.com/TerenceGrover) : A brilliant polymath fullstack developer, with some weird love for frontend, data visualization and bananas.

## Disclaimer
BANaNAS is a project developed by students and is for educational and demonstration purposes only. The creators of BANaNAS are not professional statisticians and the app is not intended for professional or commercial use. The correlations found by BANaNAS should be taken with a grain of salt and used for entertainment purposes only.
