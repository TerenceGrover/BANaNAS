# <div align="center">üçå <strong style="color: yellow"> BANaNAS </strong> - The Data Correlation App üçå
Welcome to the world of BANaNAS, a web app developed by a team of four software engineering students with a passion for data analysis and a curious streak. The idea behind BANaNAS is to take two random pieces of data from around the web and see if they're related in any way. It's like a game of "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" but with data, and you never know what kind of interesting pattern you might uncover.



## <div align="center"> Concept
We believe that data analysis should be accessible to everyone, not just experts in the field. That's why we've created BANaNAS, a tool that allows users to explore data in a fun and interactive way. With BANaNAS, you never know what kind of connection you might make. It all started with a spark of inspiration and a lot of hard work, and we're excited to share BANaNAS with the world. So go ahead, give it a try and see what kind of interesting connections you can make.


## <div align="center"> How it works
BANaNAS uses top-secret algorithms to aggregate data and find correlations, but please keep in mind that the correlations found by BANaNAS should be taken with a grain of salt and a dash of humor. We encourage users to check out the sources and do their own analysis, as correlation does not equal causation.
  
  
## <div align="center"> Tech-Stack
  
BANaNAS is built with a combination of cutting-edge technologies and a commitment to learning new concepts. The team of developers leveraged the power of <strong style="color: blue">D3</strong>, <strong style="color: green">Python</strong>, <strong style="color: brown">Node</strong>, <strong style="color: orange">Express</strong>, and <strong style="color: purple">Svelte</strong> to bring BANaNAS to life. These technologies were chosen for their ability to handle data visualization, server-side processing, and interactive frontend experiences, respectively.

In addition to the primary technologies, BANaNAS also utilizes <strong style="color: red">PostgreSQL (psql)</strong> for data storage and <strong style="color: pink">Lottie SVG</strong> for animations. The use of these technologies ensures that the app is performant and visually appealing, delivering a seamless experience to the user.

The team was dedicated to learning and using the most suitable technologies for the job, always with an eye toward delivering the <strong>best possible experience</strong> to the user. The choice of technologies and the commitment to learning and implementing them is a testament to the team's passion for software engineering and data analysis.
